# Superstore Sales Dashboard

## Project Summary
This is an **interactive Excel dashboard** built from the Superstore dataset. It tracks key business metrics such as **Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, and Top Products**. Users can filter the data by **Order Year** and **Returned/Not Returned Orders** using slicers.

The dashboard demonstrates the full process of data analysis in Excel, from **data aggregation** and **PivotTables** to **visualizations** and **interactive filtering**, allowing for meaningful insights into sales performance and profitability.

## Business Insights
*(Insights are based only on orders that were **not returned**)*  

- **Furniture products** generate more sales revenue than office supplies but have much lower profit and the **lowest profit margin** among all categories.  
  - Furniture profit margins are about **15% lower** than other categories.  
- **Office supplies** have the **highest profit margin**, only slightly higher than technology products.  
- **Technology products** generate the most sales revenue and are almost tied with office supplies for the top profit margin.  
- The **West region** has the highest sales revenue and profit.  
- Total orders amounted to **9,994** with a total sales revenue of **$2,297,201**.  
  - **800 orders** were returned, totaling **$180,504** in sales revenue lost.
